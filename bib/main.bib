@article{aes3-1992,
abstract = {It has been about 6 years since the original AES3 digital audio interface specification was adopted as a standard by the Audio Engineering Society and other organizations. Much practical experience has been gained during that time, both in equipment design and in actual studio operation. The recent revision, in progress for quite some time, attempts to correct some of the known deficiencies of the original and to provide further capability. A complementary engineering guideline is also in preparation.},
