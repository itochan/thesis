IP audio transmission has emerged to solve the problems of conventional audio transmission. The AES 67 standard was established to standardize the various IP audio transmission standards that were established later. It is now possible to freely develop devices and applications without using the commercial standard which is a black box.

Therefore, we decided to implement an application conforming to AES 67 and verify the availability of the application in the actual audio field for business use.

Requirements for professional audio systems include low latency, high sound quality, and transmission stability.

In this paper, it is considered that the software audio transmission of AES 67 satisfies the requirements for professional audio.
